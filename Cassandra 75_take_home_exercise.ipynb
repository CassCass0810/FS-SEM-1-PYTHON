I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I\\'d make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.

I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I\\'m glad for the tip, but wish I didn\\'t have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I\\'d hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.

If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.

I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.

Something has gone terribly wrong with this product.  I used to love it,  but now they are just terrible.  I don't know if they changed the formula or what the problem is, but there is a terrible after taste that never used to be there before.  I've heard other customers complain about it, but I had no idea what they were talking about.  I thought they were crazy.  Turns out they were right!  Not every cup, but at least 1/2 of the last shipment had cappuchino's cups that had a very bad after taste.  Why not all?  Can't tell you. When they taste bad they taste really bad and I found myself not even being able to finish.  I'm so dissapointed....\"], [\"I had read other reviews where this was not fancy cappuccino, but more like gas station cappuccino. I have to agree. That's what I wanted.

Unfortunately, I found it too sweet for my taste.  Just so you know.\"], [\"I am not one of the super picky coffee people out there.  Before my favorite coffee was from Starbucks, the Caramel Machiato.  But I absolutely LOVE this coffee.  I don't really care that it is instant, because I think it tastes really good.  My favorite thing is that on the medium Keurig setting I do not have to do a thing to it to enjoy it.  No sugar, no cream, no nothing.  Just pop the K-cup in, hit the button and enjoy.  If you are not a really big coffee snob and like sweet flavored coffees you might love this one, I do.\"], ['I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I\\'d make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you\\'ll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I\\'m glad for the tip, but wish I didn\\'t have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I\\'d hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn\\'t as sweet and has more \"real\" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)'], [\"This coffee is so sweet that I could not take another sip. I am quite unhappy.
